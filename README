TODO:
*-write remove methods for the neighborlist
-all threading
	-including possibly ARP
-decide when we have an invalid link
-drop LSU packets
-forward LSU packets
-buffering LSU packets
-handle ospf packets (in sr_router.c) - method stub is there, it just needs to be written
-create and read in configuration file (get area id, router id, etc)
-probably some other stuff too

DONE?
-read in static routing table --> This is the routing table from the simple router
-*need to make sure everything (e.g. pwospf_iface) is initialized in pwospf_init()
-Handle default gateways (i.e. to the internet) - will be handled in the static routes
-update get_routing_if() in sr_router.c to first check dynamic forwarding table, then static one


Notes:

This is so we each have a section of the README to pose questions to each other, add notes about
our particular pieces of code, etc. Only delete things from your section.
