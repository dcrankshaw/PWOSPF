LSU's:
    The Link State Updates are sent every OSPF_DEFAULT_LSUINT seconds. The LSU includes 
    advertisements for each of its subnets' that are known to have a neighbor router connected,
    as well as all of the static routes.
HELLO's: 
    Hello packets are sent every OSPF_DEFAULT_HELLOINT seconds. 
    
The topology is given TOP_INITIALIZATION (in sr_pwospf.h) seconds to initialize before any subnets 
are deleted. After TOP_INITIALIZATION seconds, subnets and adjacencies are deleted based on 
the absence of advertisements are HELLO packets.

When a MAC address is needed for a packet and not in the ARP cache, get_mac_address is called. 
This creates an arpq entry that is added to sr->pending if it doesn't already exist. This entry 
contains the associated IP address, the constructed ARP request, a buffer for non-LSU packets, and 
a buffer for just LSU packets. When ARP requests need to be sent, a new thread is started for
each IP address that we're looking for a MAC for. Every 5 seconds, if the entry is not in the cache,
another ARP is sent. If the entry is in the cache, all of the packets in both buffers are sent, 
the thread is terminated, and the num requests is resent. If 5 requests are sent with no reply 
received, a ICMP Host Unreachable is sent for all packets in the packet buffer and the LSU's 
in the LSU buffer are all dropped. The thread is then terminated.
